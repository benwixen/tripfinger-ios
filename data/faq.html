<h3 lang="en">Map data</h3>

<dl id="mapdata">

<dt lang="en">Some places are missing on the map or have wrong names.</dt>
<dd lang="en">We separate between guide listings (with images and text) and map listings. To suggest new guide listings, or contribute changes, please click the "Contact us" button on the settings page, or email us at content@tripfinger.com.
  
  The map listings comes from <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a> (OSM). This is a mapping project similar to Wikipedia, where anybody can create and edit maps. If you see incorrect information or missing objects, you can become an OSM contributor.
</dd>

<dt lang="en">How often do you usually update the content?</dt>
<dd lang="en">As for now, we don't have a regular release schedule for maps, but the guide content is automatically updated when you are connected to a Wi-fi network.</dd>

<dt lang="en">Is there a map of a certain country in Tripfinger and how can I learn how detailed it is?</dt>
<dd lang="en">Tripfinger has maps for every country in the world, including islands. You can check how detailed they are on <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap.org</a></dd>

<dt lang="en">Where does Tripfinger store downloaded maps and my bookmarks?</dt>
<dd lang="en">On iOS, you can access all files with iTunes (select your device, then Apps and scroll down).</dd>

</dl>

<h3>GPS</h3>

<dl id="gps">

<dt lang="en">The app cannot determine my location.</dt>
<dd lang="en">Please make sure that your device has a GPS module. Location determining with GPS (with Wi-Fi and Mobile network off) might take some time. The longer the GPS has not been used, the more time it takes. The speed of location determination depends on the device, not on the app. The GPS' operation is influenced by the weather as well - it works best outdoors when the sky is clear. Problems may arise when trying to locate yourself indoors, on a narrow street or when driving a car. Also, not all mobile devices have built-in GPS receivers, such as the iPod and Wi-Fi-only iPads. On these devices our application will show your approximate location, as long as you are connected to the internet.</dd>

<dt lang="en">What is this blue circle around my position arrow?</dt>
<dd lang="en">This is your approximate location. You might be anywhere inside this blue circle, not necessarily in the center. When your position is detected clearly, the circle disappears.</dd>

<dt lang="en">Can I use the app and GPS in the flight mode?</dt>
<dd lang="en">iOS devices (8.3 + version) can use GPS in the flight mode. However, if your iOS device is 8.2 or earlier, Airplane Mode will block GPS. You can even track your flight while on the airplane if you can receive GPS signal near the windows.</dd>

<dt lang="en">What can I do if my position is determined incorrectly?</dt>
<dd lang="en">This means that your location was detected by Wi-Fi or cellular location services provided by Google or Apple. These services are not accurate and can sometimes show your position incorrectly (and unfortunately we can't fix it). Please check that GPS is enabled in your device's settings and make sure you are outdoors, as GPS signal does not work properly inside buildings.</dd>


<dt lang="en">How can I see my current speed and altitude?</dt>
<dd lang="en">Make sure that you get GPS signal and then select your current position on the map.</dd>

<dt lang="en">What does the auto-follow mode stand for and how can I activate it?</dt>
<dd lang="en">In auto-follow mode the map rotates as you move. To activate it, tap the blue arrow in the lower left corner once your location has been determined, tap the compass icon to deactivate it.</dd>
</dl>



<h3 lang="en">Navigation, routing and tracks</h3>

<dl id="navigation">

<dt lang="en">How can I create a route in Tripfinger?</dt>
<dd lang="en">Make sure your position is determined, then choose with your finger a point on the map where you want to go. Tap the "Route" icon in the pop-up window. You can change the route type by pressing the Pedestrian icon or the Car icon. If you want to choose a different start location, tap “Route” icon on the main screen. You will see the Planning Route window. Tap “From” to select a start point, tap “To” for a destination point. Press "Start" to begin moving (navigation is only available when you create a route from your current location). Press the cross in the top left corner of the screen to finish the route.</dd>

<dt lang="en">How can I manage voice instructions settings?</dt>
<dd lang="en">Open app’s settings > Navigation. Here you can choose the language and turn off voice instructions. Please note that we don’t use pre-recorded voices but TTS (text-to-speech) engine. It means that the output quality of voice and language selection depends on the TTS engine installed on your device.</dd>

<dt lang="en">Which languages are available for voice instructions in Tripfinger?</dt>
<dd lang="en">On iOS voice guidance is available in 26 languages: English, Arabic, Chinese (Traditional and Simplified), Czech, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hindi, Hungarian, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Slovak, Spanish, Swedish, Thai, Turkish.</dd>

<dt lang="en">I can’t hear voice instructions!</dt>
<dd lang="en">Make sure that your device’s volume is not muted. You can change the volume level with your device’s volume buttons.</dd>

<dt lang="en">I am not satisfied with the route Tripfinger planned for me.</dt>
<dd lang="en">Routes created by Tripfinger are not necessarily the best possible ones. However, as soon as you leave the route, the app will suggest you a new one. Don’t forget to take the following things into account when driving: traffic jams, road works, weather conditions, etc. Rely on yourself above any software.</dd>

<dt lang="en">How can I calculate distance between two arbitrary points on a map?</dt>
<dd lang="en">You can use the scale in the bottom part of the screen. You can also measure the distance to a place by creating a route, or you can tap anywhere on the map and see the straight line distance from your current location.</dd>
</dl>



<h3 lang="en">Search</h3>


<dl id="search">

<dt lang="en">How can I search on the map?</dt>
<dd lang="en">Download the country or region map first. Tap on the Search button and type the place name, address or coordinates in the search bar. You will see suggestions and search results in the list below. To view search results on the map, tap "Search" on the virtual keyboard or the "Search on map" button. For better results, enter the country name first (if you are not yet there), then city, street and house number. You will only be able to find addresses which are in the <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a> database.</dd>

<dt lang="en">How can I find the nearest shop, gas station or bank?</dt>
<dd lang="en">You can search either by name, or by category (keyword). The most popular categories are shown as icons under the search tab (food for restaurants, money for ATMs or currency exchange, fuel for gas stations, sights for places of interest, etc). Other keywords you might like to use (change according to language): bench, WC, money, food, fuel, shop, transport, sights, bicycle, cinema, hospital, library, pharmacy, phone, theater, hotel, airport, sport, police, embassy, etc.</dd>

<dt lang="en">How do I search for places that are far away from me?</dt>
<dd lang="en">If you want to search for a place in a different country (to your current location), you will need to download the relevant map, then zoom in to the right country and start searching, or simply enter the country name in the search bar.</dd>

<dt lang="en">Search cannot find a place on the map.</dt>
<dd lang="en">The place has probably not been mapped yet at <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap.org</a>. Remember that to find an object in a specific area, you will need to zoom in before you start searching.</dd>
</dl>



<h3 lang="en">Problems with the app</h3>

<dl id="problems">

<dt lang="en">I cannot install Tripfinger from AppStore.</dt>
<dd lang="en">Restart your device and try to install the app again.</dd>

<dt lang="en">What can I do if the app has stopped/crashed?</dt>
<dd lang="en">Please <a href="mailto:support@tripfinger.com">contact us immediately</a>.</dd>

<dt lang="en">I cannot download maps.</dt>
<dd lang="en">Your download can fail due to a temporary network error or specific network provider/router settings. Please try again later or use a different Wi-Fi access point.</dd>

<dt lang="en">I see blank/white screen instead of the map, what can I do?</dt>
<dd lang="en">Make sure you have saved all your bookmarks using the Share button before you continue. Close the app on the device. Connect it to a computer and open iTunes. Select your device, then Apps > Tripfinger > Documents. Find and delete settings.ini file. Restart your device. If you cannot use iTunes, save your bookmarks and reinstall the app.
</dd>

<dt lang="en">The app’s icon disappeared, what can I do?</dt>
<dd lang="en">The icon will only disappear from your iOS device if you accidentally delete the app. You can simply reinstall it.</dd>

<dt lang="en">Can I use Tripfinger on my Windows Phone/Tablet?</dt>
<dd lang="en">Our maps are available for devices running iOS, we don't plan a Windows Phone version.</dd>

</dl>



<h3 lang="en">Bookmarks (pins)</h3>

<dl id="bookmarks">

<dt lang="en">How can I save a place to bookmarks?</dt>
<dd lang="en">Tap on any place and a place page with its name will open. To add a place to bookmarks, tap the star symbol. If you tap on the place page, you will be able to see its coordinates and distance from your current location. For open areas you will need to tap and hold for a second to see a place page.</dd>

<dt lang="en">How do I edit and delete bookmarks?</dt>
<dd lang="en">Select any bookmark and tap the white banner to change its name and coordinate format, choose or add a new set, and add notes. To change the color of a bookmark tap the red dot and choose your own color. If you want to remove the bookmark, tap the star symbol again.</dd>

<dt lang="en">All my bookmarks are gone! What happened?</dt>
<dd lang="en">Don't worry! You might have accidentally made them invisible. The eye icon next to the set name indicates its visibility. Tap it to make the whole set invisible on the map (but not in the Bookmarks menu). The app can't delete bookmarks by itself. Bookmarks can be deleted only if you delete them manually. It may also happen if you installed a system update, restored a backup or used such apps like Clean Master. You can backup bookmarks via Share button in bookmarks menu or copy all .kml files from app’s folder. In iOS bookmarks are saved automatically with a system backup.</dd>

<dt lang="en">How can I sync bookmarks on several devices I use?</dt>
<dd lang="en">For the time being, you can email your bookmarks to yourself and then open them on another device. We plan to add automatic sync in a long term.</dd>
</dl>



<h3 lang="en">Preferences</h3>

<dl id="settings">

<dt lang="en">How can I change the app’s language?</dt>
<dd lang="en">Tripfinger is only available in English for the time being.</dd>

<dt lang="en">How can I change the language on the maps themselves?</dt>
<dd lang="en">The language on the maps themselves depends on the OpenStreetMap data. As a general rule, names of streets and places are written in the local language. Very often you will see two variants – the local name and the name in your device’s language. You can always add the name in your language directly at <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap.org</a>.</dd>

<dt lang="en">Does the app support different coordinates formats?</dt>
<dd lang="en">There are two formats available in the app: decimal (53.899366 27.543801) and DMS (53°53’57.72”N 27°32’37.68”E). Type coordinates in one of these formats in the search field to find or bookmark a necessary place.</dd>
